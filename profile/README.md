## 🌟 Project Overview

Resonance is a collaborative software engineering project built with Nuxt on the frontend and Django on the backend. This repository houses our collective work and serves as the central hub for development.

## 👥 Team Structure

| Backend Developers | Django API development, database management |
| Project Managers | Sprint planning, task tracking, timeline management |
| QA Engineers | Testing, bug tracking, quality assurance |

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `development` - Integration branch for testing
- `feature/[feature-name]` - For new features
- `bugfix/[bug-name]` - For bug fixes

### Pull Request Process
1. Create branch from `development`
2. Complete your work with appropriate commits
3. Submit PR to `development`
4. Require at least one code review approval
5. Pass all automated tests
6. Merge to `development`
